# Lottery

During task execution I used: bootstrap, bootstrap-datepicker, bootstrap-tagsinput, jquery, jquery-parsley(for form field validation), jquery-mask (for Phone Number's filed mask), used gived templates.

 Implemented adaptive layout (Bootstrap);

Implemented randomly choice of the winners by pushing button “New winner”

3) Implemented adding participant to table (to list of participants) after pushing  button “Save” and successeful validation.
 
Also implemented validation of fields: email and phone(checking correctness), name, date of birth(required).

I used pattern 'mediator' and MVC design pattern. Created models: of Winner and WinnerGroup and view: WinnerGroupView.

main.js- entery point.

In controller.js realized randomly choice of winners and adding a participant to the list.

In lottery.js there are settings for used plugins.
